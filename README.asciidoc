Network info
============

Simple application that shows network interfaces based on libnl and gfxprim
widgets.

What is implemented so far:

- Application loads the list of network interfaces from kernel over netlink
- Adds an file descriptor to watch for changes and updates the information

What is on TODO:

- Currently there is no code that would allow to change the network parameters
- Communication to network manager/kernel wifi stack/dhcp daemon to request connection
